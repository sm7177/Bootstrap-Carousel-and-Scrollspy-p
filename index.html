      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2" >Casts</h4>
      <p>Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) - She used to be fat, is a control freak, and is compulsively organized. She is Ross' sister and in season 7, marries long-term boyfriend Chandler and adopts 2 babies (Jack and Erica) in the last episode of the series.
        <br><br>
        Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) - Early in the series, he was a self-confessed commitment-phobe, but in season 7 finale, he marries Monica, his girlfriend of three years. One of his most famed traits is his finely-tuned sense of humour. His father is a transsexual, and works in Las Vegas and his mother is a renowned adult book writer.
        <br><br>
        Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) - He's the 'stupid' one, and is a struggling actor, but scored a break in season 2 in the soap opera Days Of Our Lives, and then again in season 7. He remained on Days of Our Lives until the end of the series. He had a lot of sexual partners and flings throughout the series, but had strong feelings for a fellow actress in season 3 and fell in love with his roommate, Rachel, in season 8. Post-finale he was the main character in the spin-off, Joey.
        <br><br>
        Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) - She's quirky, flakey, and fun-loving. She got married to Mike in season 10, but before this relationship she had never had a serious commitment. She also plays guitar and is a masseuse. Phoebe is known to have lived on the streets as a young adult after her mother committed suicide.
        <br><br>
        Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) - She first moved to New York in the first episode after running off from the altar. She is perhaps the character who has made the most development (going from spoiled, rich Daddy's girl to an independent and confident woman). She had a famous on-off relationship with Ross, which spanned the entire series. She has a daughter with Ross Geller named Emma.
        <br><br>
        Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) - A paleontologist. He had a famous on-off relationship with Rachel, who he had a crush since he was 15.
